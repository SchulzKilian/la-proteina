# Experiments — comprehensive lab notebook

Companion file to `content_masterarbeit.md`. This file is the **complete, chronological log of every experiment run**, regardless of whether the result feeds the thesis narrative. `content_masterarbeit.md` keeps the curated paper-facing findings; `experiments.md` keeps the lab record from which findings are extracted.

**Logging policy (also locked into `CLAUDE.md`):** every experimental run — training, eval, probe, smoke test, diagnostic, ablation, sweep — gets appended here automatically and without asking, no matter how small. The bar for entry is "did we run code that produced a number". The bar for `content_masterarbeit.md` is "is this defensible enough to write into the paper".

Each entry has:

- **ID + date** — assignable handle for cross-references.
- **Status** — finished / in progress / cancelled / failed.
- **Why ran** — the question the experiment was supposed to answer, and what decision or claim it feeds.
- **Configs** — exact setup (config files, recipe, hardware, run dir, wandb run IDs, checkpoint paths). Enough that someone could re-run.
- **Results** — every quantitative output. Tables, per-fold numbers, per-length numbers, weight-norm diffs, designability counts. Not just the headline.
- **Possible narrative** — does this become a Finding? If yes, link to the `content_masterarbeit.md` section. If no, note "non-narrative — kept for tuning/decision-making" and explain what decision it informs.
- **Methodological caveats** — what the data does *not* support. Single-seed, narrow N, confounded variables, etc.

When a finding is later promoted from this file into `content_masterarbeit.md`, leave the experiment entry here unchanged (do not delete) and add a back-link to the Finding section. The lab record is append-only.

## E001 — Multi-task property predictor on La-Proteina latents (2026-04-21)

**Status:** finished (1-fold complete; 5-fold sweep completed shortly after).

**Why ran:** Decide whether a small multi-task head can read 13 developability properties out of the 8d per-residue AE latent. The output (per-property R²) doubles as the upper bound on guidance quality — the steering gradient *is* the predictor's gradient, so probe accessibility ≈ steerability for that property. Direct decision input for which properties to steer.

**Configs:**
- Architecture: `PropertyTransformer`, 128d, 3 layers, 4 heads, ~350k params.
- Input: per-residue 8d latent `mean` (only `mean`, not `log_scale`) from La-Proteina's partial autoencoder.
- Targets: 13 developability properties from `developability_panel.csv` (swi, tango, net_charge, pI, iupred3, iupred3_fraction_disordered, shannon_entropy, hydrophobic_patch_total_area, hydrophobic_patch_n_large, sap, scm_positive, scm_negative, rg).
- Dataset: 56,008 proteins, length 300–800. 10% held-out test (`heldout_test_ids.txt`), 5-fold CV on remainder.
- Training: 30 epochs, AdamW lr=3e-4, 500-step linear warmup + cosine decay, batch 16 (length-bucketed), grad-clip 1.0, early stopping patience=5. Z-score normalization of targets per-fold.
- Run dir: `laproteina_steerability/logs/multitask_t1/20260421_064011/`. Checkpoint root: `checkpoints_multitask_predictor/20260421_064011/` and `…/20260421_081025/`. `latest` symlink in `checkpoints_multitask_predictor/`.

**Results:**

5-fold val R² per property (best epoch per fold; some folds shown here are still being filled in as the sweep finished):

| Property | Fold 0 | Fold 1 | Fold 2 | Fold 3 | Fold 4 | **Mean** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| iupred3 | 0.976 | — | — | — | — | ~0.976 |
| net_charge | 0.971 | — | — | — | — | ~0.97 |
| shannon_entropy | 0.966 | — | — | — | — | ~0.96 |
| pI | 0.952 | — | — | — | — | ~0.95 |
| scm_positive | 0.929 | — | — | — | — | ~0.93 |
| scm_negative | 0.924 | — | — | — | — | ~0.92 |
| tango | 0.924 | — | — | — | — | ~0.92 |
| sap | 0.870 | — | — | — | — | ~0.87 |
| iupred3_fraction_disordered | 0.865 | — | — | — | — | ~0.87 |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | 0.860 | — | — | — | — | ~0.86 |
| rg | 0.795 | 0.803 | 0.744 | 0.803 | 0.780 | 0.785 |
| hydrophobic_patch_n_large | 0.779 | — | — | — | — | ~0.78 |
| **swi** | **0.377** | **0.548** | **0.980** | **0.979** | **0.979** | **0.773** |
| r2_mean | 0.863 | 0.878 | 0.905 | 0.905 | 0.908 | 0.892 |

SWI specifics: target distribution `mean=0.7787, std=0.0101`. Folds 0/1 R² = 0.38/0.55, folds 2–4 R² ≈ 0.98. The instability is metric-driven (`R² = 1 - MSE/Var(y)` with very small `Var(y)` is split-sensitive), not learning-driven (see convergence-time table below).

Convergence-time table (epoch at which each property first reaches 90% of its final val R², averaged across folds):

| Property | Mean epoch to 90%-final | Class |
|---|---|---|
| shannon_entropy | 2.0 | fast |
| tango | 1.8 | fast |
| scm_positive | 1.6 | fast |
| scm_negative | 2.4 | fast |
| net_charge | 2.6 | fast |
| iupred3 | 2.6 | fast |
| pI | 3.6 | fast |
| iupred3_fraction_disordered | 7.2 | medium |
| sap | 8.8 | medium |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | 10.4 | medium |
| hydrophobic_patch_n_large | 13.6 | slow |
| rg | 13.6 | slow |
| swi (folds 2–4) | 2.0 | fast |

Three-level hierarchy: sequence-derived ≪ mixed ≪ structure-derived in terms of how many epochs the probe needs.

**Possible narrative:** **Yes — this is Finding 1** (`content_masterarbeit.md → ## Finding 1`). The narrow-claim there is: "5-fold mean R² 0.88 across 13 properties; 12/13 stable across folds at R² ≥ 0.78; SWI fold-variance attributable to narrow target std=0.01."

**Methodological caveats:**
- R² is a metrically poor choice for narrow-variance properties (SWI). Should be paired with per-property MSE or rank correlation.
- A single probe architecture cannot distinguish "info present in latent" from "info accessible to this probe". E002 addresses the second half by sweeping probe family.
- Reported numbers are val R², not held-out test R² (held-out test reserved in `heldout_test_ids.txt`, not yet evaluated). Optimistic estimate.

## E002 — Capacity probing of property decoders (2026-04-21)

**Status:** finished (Fold 0 only; 5-fold repeat is on the future-experiments list).

**Why ran:** E001 told us R² across 13 properties at one probe architecture. It could not separate "info is in the latent" from "info is accessible to a 350K-param Transformer". This sweep adds 7 simpler probes (linear → per-residue MLPs of growing capacity) to E001's Transformer to draw the boundary between probe-family-bottlenecked and probe-size-bottlenecked properties. Decision input for steering predictor sizing.

**Configs:**
- Probes (parameter count + aggregation):
  1. `linear` (117 params): mean-pool residues → linear → 13 properties.
  2. `mlp_h32_L1` (717 params): mean-pool → MLP (hidden 32, 1 layer) → 13.
  3. `mlp_h64_L1` (1.4K params): mean-pool → MLP (hidden 64, 1 layer) → 13.
  4. `mlp_h128_L2` (19K params): mean-pool → MLP (hidden 128, 2 layers) → 13.
  5. `per_res_mlp_h64_L1` (1.4K params): per-residue MLP (h64, 1L) → mean-pool per-property logits.
  6. `per_res_h128_L2` (19K params): per-residue MLP (h128, 2L) → mean-pool.
  7. `per_res_h256_L3` (137K params): per-residue MLP (h256, 3L) → mean-pool.
  8. `Tx (3L, 128d, 4h)` (~350K params): same as E001's Transformer; Fold 0 values reused.
- Identical data, splits, z-score stats, loss across all probes.
- Training: 20 epochs max, AdamW lr=3e-3, wd=0.01, early-stop patience=4, batch 32 length-bucketed.
- Hardware: 1× NVIDIA L4. Total wall-clock 9 min.
- Run dir: `laproteina_steerability/logs/capacity_probing/20260421_191747/`. Checkpoints at `checkpoints_capacity_probing/20260421_191747/`.

**Results — Fold 0 val R², full ladder:**

| Property | linear | mlp_h32 | mlp_h64 | mlp_h128_L2 | per_res_h64 | per_res_h128 | per_res_h256 | Tx (3L) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #params | 117 | 717 | 1.4K | 19K | 1.4K | 19K | 137K | ~350K |
| iupred3 | 0.32 | 0.36 | 0.36 | 0.39 | 0.65 | 0.88 | 0.91 | **0.98** |
| net_charge | 0.17 | 0.21 | 0.21 | 0.23 | 0.53 | **0.84** | 0.76 | **0.97** |
| shannon_entropy | 0.46 | 0.65 | 0.64 | 0.66 | 0.63 | 0.78 | 0.80 | **0.97** |
| pI | 0.19 | 0.24 | 0.24 | 0.26 | 0.51 | **0.76** | 0.69 | **0.95** |
| scm_positive | 0.28 | 0.31 | 0.31 | 0.32 | 0.45 | 0.49 | 0.50 | **0.93** |
| scm_negative | 0.19 | 0.23 | 0.23 | 0.26 | 0.31 | 0.46 | 0.44 | **0.92** |
| iupred3_fraction_disordered | 0.15 | 0.18 | 0.18 | 0.20 | 0.29 | 0.44 | 0.47 | **0.87** |
| sap | 0.05 | 0.14 | 0.14 | 0.27 | 0.10 | 0.24 | 0.28 | **0.87** |
| tango | 0.10 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.18 | 0.19 | **0.92** |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | 0.05 | 0.11 | 0.10 | 0.19 | 0.07 | 0.13 | 0.17 | **0.86** |
| hydrophobic_patch_n_large | 0.04 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.18 | 0.05 | 0.14 | 0.18 | **0.78** |
| rg | 0.02 | 0.02 | 0.03 | 0.06 | 0.03 | 0.06 | 0.06 | **0.80** |
| swi (Fold 0 only) | 0.14 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.16 | 0.28 | 0.37 | 0.37 | 0.38 |
| **r2_mean (Fold 0)** | 0.16 | 0.22 | 0.21 | 0.26 | 0.31 | 0.44 | 0.45 | **0.86** |

Class A (per-residue MLPs already unlock most of the R²): iupred3, net_charge, pI, shannon_entropy, iupred3_fraction_disordered, swi.
Class B (only attention unlocks): sap, tango, hydrophobic_patch_*, rg, scm_±.

`iupred3` (smooth aggregate) → R²=0.91 at `per_res_h256`; `iupred3_fraction_disordered` (threshold-count of the same per-residue signal) → R²=0.47 at `per_res_h256`. The Class A/B boundary is therefore not purely sequence-vs-structure but also smooth-vs-threshold-count.

**Possible narrative:** **Yes — this is Finding 4** (`content_masterarbeit.md → ## Finding 4`). Cross-referenced from Finding 1.

**Methodological caveats:**
- Single fold (Fold 0). h128→h256 regressions on net_charge (0.84→0.76) and pI (0.76→0.69) need a 5-fold repeat before "saturation at h128" is firm.
- Capacity ladder is non-uniform in architectural complexity at the per-residue-MLP → Tx step (3 changes at once: attention, multi-layer residue-residue, different aggregation). An intermediate 1-head/1-layer attention probe would isolate the minimum attention budget.
- All per-residue probes use mean-pool. Other aggregations (learned weighted pool, max, set-transformer) untested.
- Tx column is from E001's Fold 0 — uses 30-epoch budget vs the other probes' 20-epoch early-stop. Same-protocol Tx rerun would tighten the comparison.

## E003 — Latent geometry of the partial autoencoder (2026)

**Status:** finished.

**Why ran:** Before training property probes (E001/E002) and before designing steering objectives, characterise the AE latent itself. Concrete decisions this informs: (a) is the latent posterior-collapsed? (no → predictors have signal to work with); (b) are dims locally disentangled? (yes → multi-objective steering gradients won't always conflict); (c) does within-protein variance exceed between-protein? (yes → protein-level steering objectives can be averaged from per-residue latents without information loss).

**Configs:**
- Pipeline: `laproteina_steerability/src/part1_latent_geometry/` (Part 1 of the steerability analysis pipeline, see CLAUDE.md → Steerability Analysis Pipeline).
- Data: 56,008 proteins, length 300–800; 22.66M residues total; only `mean` field (8d per-residue) loaded.
- Outputs: `laproteina_steerability/outputs/part1_summary.md`, `outputs/tables/*.csv`, `outputs/figures/*.{png,pdf}`.

**Results:**

Dimensionality and utilization:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Participation ratio | 7.694 / 8 |
| Effective rank for 90% / 95% / 99% variance | 7D / 8D / 8D |
| Collapsed dims (variance < 1% of max) | 0 |
| Max \|off-diagonal Pearson\| between dim pairs | 0.102 |
| Max pairwise MI | 0.28 nats |

Marginal distributions (Shapiro on n=5000 subsample per dim):

| Dim | std | skewness | kurtosis | Shapiro W |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.88 | +0.64 | +1.58 | 0.941 |
| 1 | 0.86 | −0.14 | +1.52 | 0.984 |
| 2 | 0.81 | +0.07 | +1.77 | 0.978 |
| **3** | 1.04 | −0.18 | **−0.42** | 0.989 |
| 4 | 0.96 | +0.05 | +0.23 | 0.997 |
| 5 | 0.98 | +0.02 | +0.87 | 0.980 |
| 6 | 0.93 | +0.06 | +0.10 | 0.993 |
| **7** | 1.05 | +0.11 | **−0.37** | 0.996 |

Dims 3 and 7 are platykurtic (negative kurtosis), consistent with discretely clustered (multimodal) marginals.

Within-protein vs between-protein variance:

| Dim | within-protein | between-protein | within/total |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.762 | 0.007 | 1.04 |
| 1 | 0.741 | 0.002 | 1.04 |
| 2 | 0.656 | 0.002 | 1.04 |
| 3 | 1.075 | 0.007 | 1.04 |
| 4 | 0.917 | 0.006 | 1.05 |
| 5 | 0.950 | 0.003 | 1.04 |
| 6 | 0.857 | 0.004 | 1.03 |
| 7 | 1.093 | 0.006 | 1.05 |

Within-protein variance is 100× between-protein on every dim.

Length sensitivity (Pearson r of per-protein-mean of each dim vs sequence length):

| Quantity | Pearson r |
|---|---|
| dim_0 mean | −0.027 |
| dim_1 mean | −0.042 |
| dim_2 mean | +0.020 |
| **dim_3 mean** | **+0.164** |
| dim_4 mean | +0.098 |
| dim_5 mean | +0.089 |
| dim_6 mean | +0.028 |
| dim_7 mean | −0.032 |
| L2 norm of latent | +0.040 |

**Possible narrative:** **Yes — this is Finding 3** (`content_masterarbeit.md → ## Finding 3`).

**Methodological caveats:**
- Pairwise dependencies measured with Pearson + empirical MI; higher-order or manifold dependencies not captured.
- Within/between ratio of ~1.04 ignores positional autocorrelation along the chain.
- Multimodality on dims 3 and 7 inferred from negative kurtosis only; no mixture model fit.

## E004 — Flow-field curvature on Proteina Complexa (2026)

**Status:** finished.

**Why ran:** Quantify how curved the learned ODE field is, separately for `bb_ca` and `local_latents`. Decision input for whether one-shot or few-step denoising is feasible per-channel (it is for `bb_ca`, not for `local_latents`), and for whether non-uniform t-grids (more NFEs near curvature peaks) could improve sample quality at fixed budget.

**Configs:**
- Checkpoints: `LD3_ucond_notri_800.ckpt` (flow model) + `AE2_ucond_800.ckpt` (autoencoder).
- Setup: 800-step uniform t-grid as proxy for continuous-time field; record per-residue per-step displacement; aggregate per channel.
- Operating point: `nsamples=8`, `nres=400`.
- Output: `checkpoints_laproteina/straightness_ld3.json`.

**Results:**

| Channel | Straightness ratio R | x1-pred variance | Step-length min | Step-length max | max\|Δ²\| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bb_ca` | **0.9353** | 0.1083 | 1.98e-3 (t=0.006) | 7.50e-2 (t=0.000) | 7.30e-2 @ t=0.001 |
| `local_latents` | **0.5086** | 0.1230 | 1.25e-3 (t=0.445) | 3.58e-3 (t=0.868) | 4.03e-3 @ t=0.043 |

`bb_ca`: 37× larger first-step displacement (essentially a free Gaussian-prior sample) then near-constant ~2–2.5e-3 climbing smoothly through the trajectory. Field is very straight outside t=0.

`local_latents`: per-step displacement spans 1.25–3.58e-3 (std/mean ≈ 0.31). Mid-trajectory dip at t≈0.445, peak near t≈0.868. Half of total motion is "sideways correction".

**Possible narrative:** **Yes — this is Finding 2** (`content_masterarbeit.md → ## Finding 2`).

**Methodological caveats:**
- R is computed at one operating point (`nsamples=8`, `nres=400`); not verified at other lengths/batches.
- Discretization error of 800-step grid not quantified.
- Channel-R comparison conflates field curvature with dimensionality (3d bb_ca vs 8d local_latents).
- Causal claim ("curvature explains one-shot denoising difficulty") is plausible but not tested via schedule-vs-quality ablation.

## E005 — Cheap diagnostics: PDB vs generated property correlations (2026-04)

**Status:** finished.

**Why ran:** Before designing the steering experiment, sanity-check that (a) generated samples (unguided) have a property distribution similar enough to PDB that the steering predictor (trained on PDB) will be in-distribution at inference time, and (b) which property pairs are correlated in nature — to avoid setting a steering objective that's actually trying to fight a strong native correlation. Decision input for steering objective selection and for interpreting collateral effects in E007.

**Configs:**
- Inputs:
  - PDB property file: `laproteina_steerability/data/properties.csv` (56,008 rows, length 300–800).
  - Generated property file: `results/generated_baseline_300_800/properties_generated.csv` (100 unguided samples).
- Code: `analysis_cheap_diagnostics/run_cheap_diagnostics.py`.
- Outputs: `analysis_cheap_diagnostics/summary.md`, `length_bin_counts.csv`, `pdb_pearson_corr.csv`, `pdb_spearman_corr.csv`, `li_ji_per_bin.csv`, plus chained training-loss plots `train_loss_chained.png` / `val_loss_chained.png` and pulled wandb history `wandb_history_chained.csv`.

**Results:**

Length distribution match (300–800 only): `KS D=0.0769, p=5.69e-1`. PDB n=56,008, generated n=100. **No detectable length-distribution mismatch.**

Effective number of independent properties (Li-Ji M_eff): Pearson 9.0 / Spearman 10.0 (out of 14). Properties cluster into ~9–10 effective groups.

Top 10 |Pearson| pairs on PDB:

| prop A | prop B | r |
|---|---|---|
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | hydrophobic_patch_n_large | +0.908 |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | sap | +0.901 |
| net_charge | pI | +0.855 |
| hydrophobic_patch_n_large | sap | +0.837 |
| iupred3 | iupred3_fraction_disordered | +0.741 |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | rg | +0.632 |
| tango | rg | +0.570 |
| tango_aggregation_positions | sap | +0.540 |
| net_charge | scm_negative | +0.524 |
| scm_positive | scm_negative | -0.518 |

Top 10 |Spearman| pairs:

| prop A | prop B | rho |
|---|---|---|
| net_charge | pI | +0.941 |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | sap | +0.878 |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | hydrophobic_patch_n_large | +0.843 |
| iupred3 | iupred3_fraction_disordered | +0.766 |
| hydrophobic_patch_n_large | sap | +0.752 |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | rg | +0.703 |
| tango | rg | +0.603 |
| swi | iupred3 | +0.600 |
| sap | rg | +0.564 |
| scm_negative | rg | -0.560 |

Bonferroni thresholds at α=0.05: naive (14 tests) 0.00357; Li-Ji Pearson (9.00 tests) 0.00556; Li-Ji Spearman (10.00 tests) 0.00500.

Per-bin Li-Ji M_eff (Spearman, PDB) is 9–10 across all 50-residue bins from [300,800), so the property-clustering structure is stable across length.

**Possible narrative:** **Non-narrative — kept for tuning/decision-making.** Direct downstream uses:
- The strong native correlation between (net_charge ↔ pI) is **why E007's net_charge-up steering also moved pI upwards** by +0.79 even though pI was not steered — collateral on natively-correlated properties is expected.
- The (scm_+ ↔ scm_−) negative correlation predicts that steering scm_+ up will pull scm_− down. Worth noting if a scm experiment is ever designed.
- M_eff ≈ 9 means "reporting 13 separate p-values is overcounting"; multiple-testing thresholds in any future steering eval should be Li-Ji-corrected.

**Methodological caveats:**
- Generated n=100 vs PDB n=56,008. Length-KS at this sample size has limited power to detect mid-tail mismatches.
- Generated samples are from a single unguided checkpoint — does not test property-distribution drift across sampling configurations.
- Li-Ji M_eff assumes Gaussian-like marginals; some properties (fraction_disordered, hydrophobic_patch_n_large) are heavy-tailed and the M_eff estimate is approximate.

## E006 — Steering smoke test (pre-round1, 2026-04)

**Status:** finished.

**Why ran:** End-to-end engineering check before running the real steering eval (E007). Confirms (a) the predictor checkpoint loads, (b) gradients propagate through `z_1_est = z_t + (1-t) v` without numerical issues, (c) guided + unguided runs both produce property CSVs in the expected schema, (d) `comparison.csv` and `summary.csv` get written. No claim attached.

**Configs:**
- Run dir: `results/steering_eval/smoke_test/`.
- Outputs present: `run_config.yaml`, `guided_properties.csv`, `unguided_properties.csv`, `comparison.csv`, `summary.csv`, `diagnostics/`. (No `report.txt`, this was a pre-flight only.)

**Results:** all expected files written; pipeline shape OK. No quantitative claim recorded for this run.

**Possible narrative:** **Non-narrative — engineering smoke.** Logged here only so the existence of `results/steering_eval/smoke_test/` is traceable.

**Methodological caveats:** N/A (smoke test).

## E007 — Steering round 1: net_charge ↑ (2026-04)

**Status:** finished.

**Why ran:** First real steering evaluation on La-Proteina. net_charge was chosen because (a) E001 ranked it as one of the most probe-accessible properties (Class A, R² ≈ 0.97 at Tx, ~0.84 already at per-residue MLP h128), so the gradient signal is expected to be reliable, (b) net_charge has well-defined sign (no symmetry issue) and a wide PDB range, so a "successful steer" produces a large, easy-to-detect shift, (c) the predictor was trained at z-score scale and unit-normalised gradients are used, so this is also a test that `w_max` is the only knob needed to control magnitude.

**Configs:**
- Objective: `[{"direction": "maximize", "property": "net_charge", "weight": 1.0}]`.
- Sample N: 5 guided + 5 unguided proteins (paired).
- ODE: 200 steps; `inference_ucond_notri` family; backbone-only (`bb_ca`) + latent steering (latent channel only).
- Predictor: same checkpoint as E001 (`PropertyTransformer`, 128d, 3L, 4h).
- Run dir: `results/steering_eval/round1_net_charge_up/`. Files: `run_config.yaml`, `report.txt`, `summary.csv`, `comparison.csv`, `guided/`, `unguided/`, `diagnostics/`.

**Results:**

Steered property (intended target):

| property | mean Δ | std Δ | p-value | frac correct direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| net_charge_ph7 | **+23.45** | 4.61 | **0.0003**\*\*\* | **1.00** |

Collateral effects on the other 13 properties (non-steered):

| property | mean Δ | std Δ | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|
| swi | -0.0058 | 0.0027 | 0.0086\* |
| tango_total | -0.347 | 27.12 | 0.979 |
| tango_aggregation_positions | -0.20 | 0.45 | 0.374 |
| pI | +0.794 | 0.929 | 0.129 |
| iupred3_mean | -0.040 | 0.038 | 0.078 |
| iupred3_fraction_disordered | -0.059 | 0.053 | 0.068 |
| shannon_entropy | -0.027 | 0.025 | 0.076 |
| hydrophobic_patch_total_area | +182.5 | 338.5 | 0.294 |
| hydrophobic_patch_n_large | +0.6 | 1.14 | 0.305 |
| sap_total | -0.313 | 0.453 | 0.198 |
| scm_positive | +15.63 | 14.57 | 0.075 |
| scm_negative | **+12.92** | 3.88 | **0.0017**\* |
| radius_of_gyration | +0.0004 | 0.0024 | 0.735 |

Designability (ESMFold scRMSD): **not computed in this run** ("ESMFold not available, skipping designability evaluation"). Verdict from `report.txt`: "STEERING WORKS: all steered properties shifted significantly in the correct direction."

Notable collateral analysis:
- `pI` rises by +0.79 (not significant, p=0.129) — directionally consistent with E005's strong native correlation `(net_charge, pI) Pearson +0.855 / Spearman +0.941`. Steering net_charge up *should* drag pI up; the small N=5 means it didn't reach significance but the sign is right.
- `scm_negative` rises by +12.9 (p=0.002, significant) — also consistent with the E005-observed `(net_charge, scm_negative) Pearson +0.524`.
- `scm_positive` rises by +15.6 (p=0.075, marginal) — adding positive charges naturally pulls SCM-positive up; expected.
- `swi` drops by 0.006 (p=0.009, significant). SWI std=0.01, so this is a 0.6-σ drop. Sign is consistent with hydrophobicity dropping when net_charge rises.

**Possible narrative:** **Potential narrative.** Could become a Finding ("steering works for the most probe-accessible Class A property; collateral effects on the strongly natively-correlated properties (pI, scm_±) are expected from E005 and observed; designability not yet measured"), but **N=5 is too small to write into the paper** without scaling up. The natural follow-up is N=30–50 with ESMFold designability included. Logged here so the result is recoverable; not yet promoted to `content_masterarbeit.md`.

**Methodological caveats:**
- N=5 is below standard significance thresholds for collateral-effect inference. The "significant" entries (swi, scm_negative) survive Bonferroni-13 (threshold 0.0038) for swi but not for scm_negative; under Li-Ji-9 from E005 (threshold 0.0056) only swi survives.
- Designability not computed → cannot tell whether the +23 net_charge shift came at the cost of going off-manifold. Until ESMFold is wired in for this eval, the verdict "STEERING WORKS" is provisional.
- Steering was applied via the latent channel only; no backbone-channel guidance was tested in this round.

## E008 — Canonical CA-only baseline training (old recipe, 2026-04-21 → ongoing chain)

**Status:** finished (chain). Best raw checkpoint preserved on disk.

**Why ran:** Reference baseline against which all CA-only architectural variants (E010 sparse attention, future conv-downsampling) are compared. Goal: lock in a single, citable run with a documented config, val curve, and designability table. **Decisions encoded by this run** are listed below; future variants should not silently revisit them.

**Configs:**
- Run name: `test_ca_only_diffusion`. Store dir: `/home/ks2218/la-proteina/store/test_ca_only_diffusion/1776805213/`.
- Saved exp-config (source of truth): `…/checkpoints/exp_config_test_ca_only_diffusion.json`.
- Wandb chain: `d1k1587u` → `jeponiu5` → `0fnyfbi9`.
- Best raw checkpoint on disk: `…/checkpoints/best_val_00000026_000000002646.ckpt`. (The original step-2204 best from `jeponiu5` was overwritten by later `best_val_*` saves under `save_top_k=1`.)
- Hardware: 1× A100 (Cambridge HPC ampere); `ngpus_per_node_=1`, `nnodes_=1`.

Architecture (NN config — exact match to `configs/nn/ca_only_score_nn_160M.yaml`):
- 160M-parameter `LocalLatentsTransformer`. `nlayers=14`, `token_dim=768`, `nheads=12`, `parallel_mha_transition=False`, `use_qkln=True`.
- Output: `output_parameterization: {bb_ca: v}`. No `local_latents` head, no autoencoder, `latent_dim=None`.
- Pair representation: `pair_repr_dim=256`, `seq_sep_dim=127`, `xt_pair_dist_dim=30 (0.1–3 nm)`, `x_sc_pair_dist_dim=30 (0.1–3 nm)`.
- Conditioning: `dim_cond=256`, `t_emb_dim=256`, `idx_emb_dim=256`.
- Features: seq = `[xt_bb_ca, x_sc_bb_ca, optional_ca_coors_nm_seq_feat, optional_res_type_seq_feat]`; pair = `[rel_seq_sep, xt_bb_ca_pair_dists, x_sc_bb_ca_pair_dists, optional_ca_pair_dist]`; pair-cond = `[time_emb_bb_ca]`.
- Deliberately off: `update_pair_repr=False`, `use_tri_mult=False`, `use_downsampling=False`, `parallel_mha_transition=False`, `strict_feats=False`, no LoRA (`lora.r: null`).

Recipe (the "old recipe" — locked-in canonical for variants):
- `torch.optim.AdamW`, `weight_decay=0.05` uniform, `lr=2e-4` constant (no scheduler, no warmup, no decay). β1=0.9, β2=0.999, ε=1e-8 (PyTorch defaults).
- `accumulate_grad_batches=32`, `dataset.datamodule.batch_size=6`, `max_padding_size=512` → effective batch ≈ 192 proteins/optimizer step.
- bf16-mixed precision (`force_precision_f32: False`), `gradient_clip_val=1.0` norm.
- EMA: `decay=0.999`, `every_n_steps=5`, `validate_original_weights=False`, `cpu_offload=False`.
- `val_check_interval=2000` mini-batches → ~63 optimizer steps between val evals.
- Self-conditioning on (`self_cond=True`), `n_recycle=0`, `motif_conditioning=False`, `p_folding_n_inv_folding_iters=0.0`, `use_precomputed_latents=False`.
- Data filter: `worst_resolution ≤ 2.0 Å`, `min_length=50`, `max_length=512`. Sequence-similarity 0.5 split, val set size = 4058 proteins.
- `seed=42`, `dist_strategy=auto`.

**Results:**

Validation:
- Best val ≈ 4.71–4.77 around opt step 1800–2200. `d1k1587u` best 4.765 at step 1827; `jeponiu5` best 4.712 at step 2204 (ckpt overwritten).
- Past best, val rises to 5+ within 200–700 more steps (overfit).

Designability (ESMFold scRMSD < 2 Å, 200 ODE steps, N=3 per length):

| step | L=50 (min/mean/max scRMSD Å) | L=50 des | L=100 | L=100 des | L=200 | L=200 des |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1889 | 1.56 / 3.00 / 4.07 | 1/3 | 1.66 / 2.01 / 2.56 | 2/3 | — | — |
| 2457 (post-uptick) | 1.29 / 2.40 / 3.59 | 1/3 | 1.54 / 5.10 / 12.03 | 2/3 | 4.04 / 7.91 / 11.45 | 0/3 |

These numbers are the bar a variant must clear.

**Decisions encoded in this run (do NOT silently revisit them in variants):**
- wd held at 0.05 because higher wd collapses AdaLN-Zero output gates and destroys designability while improving val loss (E009 / Finding 5). Raising wd requires restructuring `configure_optimizers` first.
- LR schedule constant because cosine_with_warmup did not help in v2 (it co-occurred with the wd=0.1 collapse and was not isolated).
- `update_pair_repr=False` — no evidence the pair-update layer helps the CA-only task, and it adds compute.
- `use_tri_mult=False` — incompatible with the planned sparse-attention variant (`pair_update.py:65` raises) and unnecessary in baseline.
- 1-GPU configuration with `accumulate_grad_batches=32` is the deliberate match to the original 4-GPU effective batch (`4×8×6 = 1×32×6`).
- N=3 designability checks per length at 2–3 lengths is the cheap proxy for sample quality. Required as a stopping rule for any variant — val loss alone is insufficient (see E009).

**Possible narrative:** **Yes — this is the "Baseline reference" anchor in `content_masterarbeit.md`** (`## Baseline reference — canonical CA-only run`), and is referenced by Findings 5 and the run-comparison entries.

**Methodological caveats:**
- N=3 designability per length is small for fine-grained scRMSD distribution claims; sufficient for "designable vs not" gating but not for headline numbers.
- Step-1889 and step-2457 designability was measured at the time those checkpoints existed; the original ckpts were overwritten under `save_top_k=1` (the file currently on disk is step 2646). Per-step designability claims can no longer be re-run from disk for those exact steps.
- Wall-clock per opt-step is ~131 steps/hour with the v2-era `on_before_optimizer_step` logging in place (~300 steps/hour without); the two full-parameter L2 traversals per step are the bottleneck. Throughput was higher during the original training.

## E009 — v2 recipe attempt: wd=0.1 + cosine_with_warmup (2026-04-23 → 2026-04-25)

**Status:** finished, cancelled at step 2294 after a confirmed two-eval val uptick. Best raw + EMA checkpoints preserved.

**Why ran:** Test whether the standard "modern" recipe (wd=0.1 + cosine_with_warmup LR) improves on the old recipe (wd=0.05, constant LR=2e-4) on the canonical CA-only baseline. Hypothesis was that this would deliver a strict improvement to the baseline. **Result: it did not — see post-mortem below; this experiment is the basis of Finding 5.**

**Configs:**
- Run name: `ca_only_diffusion_baseline_v2`. Store dir: `store/ca_only_diffusion_baseline_v2/1776975226/`.
- Wandb chain: `9jp15of2` (slot 1) → `5rftn43a` (slot 2) → `43xxlbzt` (slot 3, after a chain failure on broken GPU node `gpu-q-43`).
- Best raw checkpoint (preserved): `…/checkpoints/best_val_00000020_000000002078.ckpt`. EMA companion at the same path with `-EMA.ckpt` suffix.
- Hardware: 1× A100 (Cambridge HPC ampere), 3 chained 6h SLURM slots, ~18h wall-clock total to step 2294.
- Architecture: identical to E008.
- Recipe diff vs E008:
  - `torch.optim.AdamW`, `weight_decay=0.10` (vs 0.05).
  - LR: `cosine_with_warmup` (linear warmup 0 → 2e-4 over 200 opt steps, cosine decay to `min_lr_ratio × peak = 2e-5` at `total_steps=6000`) (vs constant 2e-4).
  - Both versions apply weight decay uniformly to all parameters (`configure_optimizers` does not split into wd/no-wd groups).
- Reference old checkpoint used in the post-mortem comparison: `store/test_ca_only_diffusion/1776805213/checkpoints/best_val_00000026_000000002646.ckpt`.

**Results — validation:**

Best validation loss (`validation_loss/loss_epoch`, single MC estimate per eval):

| Recipe | Best val | At opt step | Behaviour past best |
|---|---|---|---|
| Old (E008) | **4.765** | 1827 | rises to 4.79–5.39 within 250–700 steps |
| New v2 | **4.437** | 2078 | rises to 4.78 by step 2267 |
| **Δ (v2 − old)** | **−0.328** | +251 steps | — |

Head-to-head v2 vs `d1k1587u` at matched optimizer steps (val_loss):

| step | v2 | d1k1587u | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1448 | 5.543 | 5.085 | +0.458 |
| 1511 | 5.216 | 5.063 | +0.154 |
| 1637 | 5.093 | 5.042 | +0.052 |
| 1700 | 5.029 | 4.866 | +0.163 |
| 1763 | 4.875 | 4.786 | +0.089 |
| **1827** | **4.724** | 4.765 (old's best) | **−0.041** ← v2 crosses under |
| 1889 | 4.671 | 4.792 (old's uptick begins) | −0.121 |
| 1952 | 4.506 | 4.787 | −0.282 |
| 2078 | **4.437** (v2 best) | — | — |
| 2267 | 4.781 (uptick) | — | — |

Per-length val (v2 only, around the uptick):

| length bin | step 2015 | step 2078 | step 2142 | step 2204 | step 2267 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50–175  | 4.244 | 4.316 | 4.078 | 4.283 | 4.344 |
| 175–300 | 4.508 | 4.300 | 4.548 | 4.915 | 5.022 |
| 300–425 | 4.945 | 4.775 | 4.957 | 4.924 | 5.292 |
| 425–513 | 5.180 | 4.916 | 5.102 | 5.396 | 5.097 |

**Results — sample quality (designability via ESMFold scRMSD):**

After observing the val improvement, samples were generated under matching inference (`generation/uncond_codes_ca_only`, 200 ODE steps, `designability_modes=[ca, bb3o]`, `folding_models=[esmfold]`). N=3 per length, threshold scRMSD < 2 Å:

| Run / step | L=50 (min/mean/max) | L=50 des | L=100 | L=100 des | L=200 | L=200 des |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Old, step 1889 | 1.56 / 3.00 / 4.07 | 1/3 | 1.66 / 2.01 / 2.56 | 2/3 | — | — |
| Old, step 2457 (post-uptick) | 1.29 / 2.40 / 3.59 | 1/3 | 1.54 / 5.10 / 12.03 | 2/3 | 4.04 / 7.91 / 11.45 | 0/3 |
| **v2, step 2078 (best val)** | **4.22 / 9.10 / 14.83** | **0/3** | **8.00 / 11.28 / 13.41** | **0/3** | **7.96 / 9.60 / 11.03** | **0/3** |

v2 produces **zero designable samples at any tested length**. Even the v2 *minimum* scRMSD at L=50 (4.22 Å) is worse than the old *maximum* (4.07 Å, step 1889).

**Results — per-layer weight diff (post-mortem):**

Loaded both raw checkpoints on CPU and computed L2 norm per parameter tensor in `state_dict()`:

- Global weight L2 norm: v2 = 430.33, old = 438.73 → ratio 0.981 (v2 only 1.9% smaller globally; cannot account for the sample collapse on its own).
- Layer-wise ratio (v2/old) over 164 layers ≥ 10k params: mean = 0.920, median = 0.967, stdev = 0.148, **min = 0.260, max = 1.376**.
- Top-10 most-changed layers (largest |ratio − 1|) are **all** AdaLN-Zero output gates of upper transformer blocks:

| layer | old norm | v2 norm | ratio v2/old |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nn.transformer_layers.10.mhba.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight`       | 1.815 | 0.471 | **0.260** |
| `nn.transformer_layers.9.transition.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight`  | 0.988 | 0.280 | **0.283** |
| `nn.transformer_layers.9.mhba.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight`        | 1.527 | 0.456 | **0.299** |
| `nn.transformer_layers.10.transition.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight` | 0.576 | 0.260 | 0.451 |
| `nn.transformer_layers.8.transition.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight`  | 0.625 | 0.283 | 0.453 |
| `nn.transformer_layers.7.mhba.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight`        | 1.765 | 0.801 | 0.454 |
| `nn.transformer_layers.13.transition.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight` | 0.534 | 0.263 | 0.493 |
| `nn.transformer_layers.11.transition.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight` | 0.563 | 0.302 | 0.536 |
| `nn.transformer_layers.13.mhba.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight`       | 1.454 | 0.801 | 0.551 |
| `nn.transformer_layers.12.transition.scale_output.to_adaln_zero_gamma.0.weight` | 0.557 | 0.331 | 0.595 |

The 10 most-similar layers (ratio 0.99–1.00) are all AdaLN modulation γ/β weights — essentially unchanged.

**Mechanism (DiT/SiT-style AdaLN-Zero × naive uniform-AdamW-wd):**

AdaLN-Zero (DiT, Peebles & Xie 2023) adds a per-block output gate `α(c)` modulating each residual contribution: `x ← x + α(c)·Block(AdaLN(x, c))`. The linear layer producing α is **zero-initialized**, so the network behaves as identity at init; the gates need to *grow* under gradient signal. Weight decay's job is to push weights toward zero. With uniform wd applied to all parameters including the gates, the gradient signal is in continuous tension with the wd pull. At wd=0.05 the gates grow (slowly) to useful magnitudes; at wd=0.1 — especially in deeper layers where gradient signal is weaker — wd pull dominates, gates stay small. Suppressed gates → conditioning barely reaches velocity output → predicted velocities ≈ time-averaged velocity (smoother, lower-variance MSE → lower val loss) → integrated trajectories at inference have no coherent time-conditioning → samples collapse.

Standard fix in DiT/SiT/SD3: parameter groups in AdamW that exclude (a) AdaLN-Zero gate parameters, (b) biases, (c) LayerNorm γ/β, (d) embeddings from weight decay. La-Proteina's `configure_optimizers` does not implement this split. With the codebase as-is, **wd is bounded above by what AdaLN-Zero gates can tolerate**, experimentally ≤ 0.05.

**Possible narrative:** **Yes — this is Finding 5** (`content_masterarbeit.md → ## Finding 5`). The narrow claim there: "wd=0.1+cosine reduces best val by 0.328 but produces 0/3 designable at every L; per-layer weights show 40–74% gate-norm reduction in upper transformer layers; val loss is therefore not a reliable proxy on this codebase under uniform-wd AdamW."

A causal ablation isolating the wd from the LR schedule (and confirming gate-recovery via param-group fix recovers samples) is registered in `content_masterarbeit.md → Future experiments → Causal ablation of the AdaLN-Zero × weight-decay collapse mechanism`.

**Methodological caveats:**
- N=3 designability per length is the same low-N gate as E008; the categorical gap (every v2 sample worse than every old sample at every length) holds regardless.
- Step-1889 / step-2457 old-recipe ckpts were overwritten under `save_top_k=1`; the per-layer post-mortem used step-2646 (post-uptick from chained continuation). Despite being *worse* by val-loss, step-2646 still produces dramatically better samples than v2-2078, so the v2 collapse cannot be explained by old-checkpoint selection.
- The mechanism is consistent with the per-layer evidence and DiT-family literature, but has not been formally verified by an ablation. That ablation (~16h on 1 A100) is registered as future work.
- v2 had two confounded variables (wd 0.05→0.10 + scheduler constant→cosine_with_warmup). The mechanism is wd-specific, not LR-schedule-specific (LR decay slows gate growth but does not pull weights toward zero), so the wd is the load-bearing cause on mechanistic grounds. A causal ablation that varies them independently would settle the residual ambiguity.
- The val-loss numbers themselves (Δ = −0.328 in best-val) are real and reproducible; the framing of v2 as "an improvement" is what is retracted, not the val number.
- Chain was cancelled at step 2294 with cosine LR still at 1.48e-4 (out of 6000 scheduled). The collapse is therefore not formally proven to not recover with further training, but the mechanism predicts further training would *worsen* gate suppression, not recover it.

## E010 — Sparse-attention variant K=32 training (2026-04-25, in progress)

**Status:** in progress (training; ≥ step 1259 as of 2026-04-26). Designability eval pending.

**Why ran:** Architectural variant of the CA-only baseline (E008). Replaces dense `[B,N,N,d]` pair representation + dense attention with a per-residue neighbor list. The thesis question is two-fold: (a) does sparse attention preserve sample quality at matched recipe and matched per-step training budget? (architectural axis), and (b) does the implementation realise the FLOP savings as wall-clock at n=512? (throughput axis). Defensible negative throughput finding already observed at smoke-test time (see below).

**Configs:**
- Run name: `ca_only_sparse_K40` (**misnomer — actual K=32, not 40**; see below). Store dir: `store/ca_only_sparse_K40/1777125234/`.
- Saved exp-config: `…/checkpoints/exp_config_ca_only_sparse_K40.json`.
- Wandb chain: `c60iiywv` → `pgdo2dw3` (training in progress).
- Architecture (sparse arm): `configs/nn/ca_only_sparse_160M.yaml` — byte-equivalent to `ca_only_score_nn_160M.yaml` (E008's NN config) except for four added keys:
  - `sparse_attention=True`
  - `n_seq_neighbors=8` (NOT 16 as the run name suggests)
  - `n_spatial_neighbors=8`
  - `n_random_neighbors=16` (∝ 1/d³)
  - ⇒ K = 8 + 8 + 16 = **32** (not 40).
  - Verified 2026-04-26 from saved exp_config and runtime `cfg_exp.nn` log.
  - The original design intent had been 16/8/16=K=40; the YAML committed and run is 8/8/16=K=32. The run name is preserved to keep the store-dir and wandb history valid; an actual K=40 run would be a separate variant.
- Architecture (dense control = E008): `store/test_ca_only_diffusion/1776805213/checkpoints/best_val_00000026_000000002646.ckpt`. Not retrained.
- Recipe: identical to E008 (canonical OLD recipe — wd=0.05, constant LR=2e-4, no scheduler, accumulate_grad_batches=32, batch_size=6, EMA decay=0.999 every 5 steps, seed=42, bf16-mixed, val_check_interval=2000, data filter ≤2.0 Å resolution + length 50–512, 1× A100). Verified by structural diff of the three `exp_config_*.json` (E008/E009/E010) on 2026-04-26.
- Eval configs (created 2026-04-25):
  - `configs/inference_ucond_notri_ca_only_baseline_quick.yaml` — control, 4 lengths × 10 samples × 200 steps, points at E008's best ckpt.
  - `configs/inference_ucond_notri_ca_only_sparse_quick.yaml` — variant; ckpt path is `PLACEHOLDER_best_val.ckpt`, must be filled in after training (see note below on `evaluate.py` argparse strictness).

Implementation files (worth knowing if anything in the sparse path is touched):
- `proteinfoundation/nn/modules/sparse_neighbors.py` — neighbor list builder (`@torch.no_grad`, recomputed each forward from `x_t["bb_ca"]`).
- `proteinfoundation/nn/modules/pair_bias_attn.py:_attn_sparse` — actual sparse attention. Switched on by presence of `neighbor_idx` argument.
- `proteinfoundation/nn/modules/pair_update.py` — sparse pair update; **raises if `use_tri_mult=True`** (line 65).
- `proteinfoundation/nn/modules/pair_rep_initial.py` — sparse-aware pair builder.
- `proteinfoundation/nn/feature_factory.py:130` — `_gather_sparse_pairs` fallback for any pair feature without `supports_sparse=True`. All current pair features have the fast path.
- `proteinfoundation/nn/local_latents_transformer.py:228-242` — wires sparse_attention from kwargs.

**Results (training):**
- Best-val ckpt at step 1259 (training in progress; final step pending).
- val curve and per-length val being logged via the same `validation_loss/loss_epoch` and `validation_loss_by_len/len_<lo>_<hi>` channels as E008/E009.

**Results (throughput, smoke-test, 2026-04-25):**
At n=512, K=32, B=6, H=12, D=64 on a single A100 (bf16-mixed, 160M model), **the sparse-attention variant runs SLOWER per optimizer step than the dense baseline** despite reducing the pair representation from `[B,N,N,d_pair]` (≈ 803 MB) to `[B,N,K,d_pair]` (≈ 50 MB) and reducing attention scores from `[B,H,N,N]` to `[B,H,N,K]` (a 16× reduction).

Mechanism (identified by code-level inspection of `_attn_sparse`):
- Sparse path materialises two `[B*H, N, K, D]` tensors per layer via `torch.gather` along the N dimension on a non-contiguous index pattern. At our shapes that's ≈ 150 MB × 2 × 14 layers ≈ 4 GB of memory-bound traffic per forward, with random N-axis access.
- Dense path has zero gathers — Q, K, V are already laid out contiguously for matmul; the dense attention kernel is bandwidth-friendly.
- Both paths use plain `einsum + softmax + einsum` (no flash/SDPA fusion), so dense does not get a kernel-fusion advantage. The throughput gap is entirely memory-access-pattern.

Crossover with dense is hypothesised at n ≥ 1024 but not measured.

**Possible narrative:** **Two axes**, both tracked here, both feed `content_masterarbeit.md → Future experiments → Sparse-attention variant vs dense baseline (pre-registered, 2026-04-25)`:

1. *Architectural axis (pending):* val-loss-vs-step + per-length val + designability at matched optimizer step. Headline claim form: *"At matched recipe and matched per-step budget on the 160M CA-only baseline, K=32 SALAD-style sparse attention (8 seq + 8 spatial + 16 random ∝ 1/d³) reaches val=X / designability=Y vs dense val=4.71-4.77 / designability per Finding 5."*

2. *Throughput axis (already defensible — negative result):* Sparse is slower per opt step than dense at n=512 in this implementation. **Defensible narrow claim already today:** *"Replacing the CA-only baseline's dense pair representation and attention with a SALAD-style K=32 sparse neighbor-list attention reduces the pair-representation memory footprint by ≈ 16× at n=512 but does not realise the FLOP savings as per-step wall-clock; the gather-based kernel is memory-bandwidth-bound."* This is the honest framing the thesis should adopt regardless of the architectural-axis outcome.

**Methodological caveats:**
- Single seed on the architectural axis. N=10 designability per length × 4 lengths is gating, not a definitive headline number.
- "Random" neighbors are ∝ 1/d³, not uniform — closer to "extra spatial neighbors with stochastic exploration" than to BigBird-style global tokens. Long-range information transport relies entirely on multi-layer composition.
- Self is excluded from each query's neighbor list (`eye` added to `base_invalid` in `sparse_neighbors.py:44`); self-info propagates only via the residual.
- Padding-slot guard (`slot_valid` in `sparse_neighbors.py:121-127`) prevents short proteins (<K=32 residues) from double-counting residue 0 in attention. Critical and untouchable.
- Neighbor list rebuilt every forward from the noisy `x_t`. At t≈0 the spatial+random groups are essentially random subsets and only sequential neighbors carry useful info — the model is implicitly trained on a connectivity-noisy-early curriculum. Whether that hurts low-t sample quality in a way that doesn't show in val loss is a known unknown.
- Throughput numbers from a single A100 in bf16-mixed; absolute steps/hour will differ on other hardware, but the relative dense-vs-sparse ordering at n=512 is structural.
- `evaluate.py` does NOT honour Hydra CLI overrides for `ckpt_path`/`ckpt_name` (its argparse is strict — see `gen_n_eval_ca_only.sh:97-102`). The eval-step YAML must be edited with the actual ckpt before running. `generate.py` does honour CLI overrides.
- Throughput-axis allocator tweak occasionally helps gather-heavy bf16: `export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` (numerically no-op).

**Things deliberately NOT combined with sparse attention on this first variant run** (so the comparison stays clean): no `update_pair_repr=True`, no `use_downsampling=True`, no non-default K (K=32 only), no LoRA. Those become separate variants if K=32 produces a working result.

## E011 — Sidechain manifold experiment (preregistered, 2026-04-25)

**Status:** preregistered / in progress (initial commit `e4ba5a6` "Sidechain manifold experiment + in-progress source/configs"). Result not yet recorded.

**Why ran:** Test whether the AE latent is more "manifold-aligned" than raw sidechain coordinates — i.e. at matched percentile-scaled noise levels (k · σ for both spaces), which space produces sidechain placements that ESMFold (conditioned on the original sequence) is closer to. If the AE latent is more manifold-aligned, that empirically justifies steering in latent space rather than coordinate space (the implicit assumption of every steering experiment so far). If it is not, steering in coord space becomes a viable alternative the thesis should at least mention.

**Configs (locked in):**
- AE checkpoint: `AE1_ucond_512.ckpt` (the 512-residue AE used for the original 355K precomputed latents, paired with LD1 in the original release).
- LD checkpoint: *not used.* This experiment touches only the AE encode/decode round-trip; the flow model is irrelevant.
- Eval set: length-stratified subset of 50–300 residue proteins from `/rds/user/ks2218/hpc-work/processed/`, seed-fixed.
- Noise levels: k ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}.
- Coord arm: Gaussian noise added to sidechain atoms (atom37 indices ∉ {0:N, 1:CA, 2:C, 4:O}) only; backbone untouched. σ = empirical per-(residue_type, atom_idx) std of the atom's offset from CA in the residue-local (N,CA,C) frame, computed across the eval set.
- Latent arm: Gaussian noise added to encoder `mean` with σ = empirical per-dim std on the eval set (≈ 1, since latents are KL-regularised toward N(0,1)). Decode with original CA coords; splice the original N/CA/C/O back so the *only* difference between conditions is sidechain placement.
- Metric: `proteinfoundation/evaluate.py` with `compute_codesignability=True`, `codesignability_modes=["all_atom"]`, `codesignability_folding_models=["esmfold"]`. ESMFold on original sequence vs perturbed structure, all-atom RMSD. Lower = closer to ESMFold's manifold.
- Code: `analysis_manifold/perturbation_experiment.py`, `analysis_manifold/aggregate_and_plot.py`.

**Why short proteins (50–300) — explicit compute-saving choice:** Sidechain conformational constraints are predominantly local (rotamer preferences, immediate neighbour packing, ~5–8 Å context). Restricting to 50–300 residues loses no power on the central claim and makes the experiment tractable on a single A100. If positive on short proteins, scale to 300–800 with AE2/LD3 as the natural follow-up; if negative, the result already disconfirms the hypothesis at the regime where it is most likely to hold.

**Caveat to record with results:** AE1 was trained on ≤512 residue proteins, so 50–300 is fully in-distribution for the encoder. A positive result for AE1 in 50–300 does not transfer mechanically to AE2 / 300–800.

**Results:** *not yet collected.* Update this entry once aggregate plots (`analysis_manifold/aggregate_and_plot.py` outputs) are produced.

**Possible narrative:** **Yes, intended to be a Finding** if the result is clean. Cross-reference: `content_masterarbeit.md → Future experiments → Sidechain manifold comparison`.

**Methodological caveats:**
- ESMFold's all-atom predictions are themselves a model output, not ground truth. The RMSD-to-ESMFold metric measures *distance to ESMFold's manifold*, not necessarily distance to the true protein manifold. A mismatch with crystal structure is therefore confounded with ESMFold's own bias.
- Noise scaling at "k · σ" is per-axis-per-modality, not equivalent in information-theoretic terms. Comparing latent-arm and coord-arm at matched k assumes equal informativeness of the σ-units across spaces — a working assumption that the experiment is partially testing.
- Splicing original N/CA/C/O back from the unperturbed structure into the latent-arm decode gives the latent arm a small backbone-fidelity advantage (CA placement is exactly preserved) that the coord-arm doesn't get (sidechains are perturbed in a frame defined by the unperturbed N/CA/C, but the local frame interaction with the perturbation isn't trivially equivalent).

## E012 — Three-run comparison: baseline / v2 / sparse side-by-side (2026-04-26)

**Status:** finished (at-time-of-comparison snapshot; sparse arm still training).

**Why ran:** Single citable record of the three CA-only training runs whose configs and outcomes are referenced elsewhere in `content_masterarbeit.md` (E008 baseline, E009 v2, E010 sparse). Confirmed by structural diff of the three saved `exp_config_*.json` files that everything except the per-run differing keys is byte-identical — so any "the variant beat the baseline" claim resolves to a row of one of these tables.

**Configs (only differing keys shown — everything else byte-identical):**

| key | baseline (E008) | v2 (E009) | sparse (E010) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `opt.weight_decay` | **0.05** | **0.10** | 0.05 |
| `opt.scheduler` | *(absent — constant LR)* | `cosine_with_warmup`, warmup=200, total=6000, min_lr_ratio=0.1 | *(absent — constant LR)* |
| `nn.sparse_attention` | *(absent → False)* | *(absent → False)* | **True** |
| `nn.n_seq_neighbors` | — | — | 8 |
| `nn.n_spatial_neighbors` | — | — | 8 |
| `nn.n_random_neighbors` | — | — | 16 |

Common to all three: `opt.lr=2e-4` constant, `opt.accumulate_grad_batches=32`, `opt.dist_strategy=auto`, `opt.val_check_interval=2000`, `hardware.ngpus_per_node_=1`, `hardware.nnodes_=1`, EMA(decay=0.999, every_n_steps=5), `seed=42`, `force_precision_f32=False`, `training.self_cond=True`, `training.n_recycle=0`, `training.p_folding_n_inv_folding_iters=0.0`, `training.use_precomputed_latents=False`, dataset filter `worst_resolution≤2.0Å, min_length=50, max_length=512`, NN backbone `nlayers=14, token_dim=768, nheads=12, pair_repr_dim=256, dim_cond=256, update_pair_repr=False, use_tri_mult=False, use_downsampling=False`.

**Identity:**

| | baseline | v2 | sparse |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run_name_` | `test_ca_only_diffusion` | `ca_only_diffusion_baseline_v2` | `ca_only_sparse_K40` (misnomer — actual K=32) |
| store dir | `store/test_ca_only_diffusion/1776805213/` | `store/ca_only_diffusion_baseline_v2/1776975226/` | `store/ca_only_sparse_K40/1777125234/` |
| wandb chain | `d1k1587u → jeponiu5 → 0fnyfbi9` | `9jp15of2 → 5rftn43a → 43xxlbzt` | `c60iiywv → pgdo2dw3` (training in progress) |
| training started | 2026-04-21 | 2026-04-23 | 2026-04-25 14:53 BST |
| status | finished | finished, cancelled at step 2294 | in progress (≥ step 1259 as of 2026-04-26) |

**Mini-eval results (designability via ESMFold scRMSD < 2 Å, 200 ODE steps, N=3 per length):**

| Run / step | L=50 (min/mean/max) | L=50 des | L=100 | L=100 des | L=200 | L=200 des |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline @ step 1889 | 1.56 / 3.00 / 4.07 | 1/3 | 1.66 / 2.01 / 2.56 | 2/3 | — | — |
| baseline @ step 2457 (post-uptick) | 1.29 / 2.40 / 3.59 | 1/3 | 1.54 / 5.10 / 12.03 | 2/3 | 4.04 / 7.91 / 11.45 | 0/3 |
| v2 @ step 2078 (best val) | 4.22 / 9.10 / 14.83 | **0/3** | 8.00 / 11.28 / 13.41 | **0/3** | 7.96 / 9.60 / 11.03 | **0/3** |
| sparse @ best val | *(eval not yet run)* | — | — | — | — | — |

Best validation loss (single MC estimate per eval):

| Run | best val | at opt step | behaviour past best |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 4.71–4.77 (4.765 in `d1k1587u`) | 1827–2204 | rises to 4.79–5.39 within 250–700 steps |
| v2 | **4.437** | 2078 | rises to 4.78 by step 2267 |
| sparse | (training in progress; latest best-val ckpt at step 1259) | — | — |

**Diff isolation — what each row's outcome can and cannot be attributed to:**

- **baseline vs v2** differs in *exactly two* knobs: `weight_decay` (0.05→0.10) and `scheduler` (constant→cosine_with_warmup). Two confounded variables, one outcome ("better val, dead samples"). Mechanism (Finding 5 / E009) — AdaLN-Zero gate collapse in upper transformer layers (gates at 26–60% of baseline magnitude in v2) — is wd-specific, not LR-schedule-specific. On mechanistic grounds the wd=0.10 is the load-bearing cause; cosine LR plausibly compounds the suppression in late training but no known mechanism predicts gate collapse from cosine LR alone. A causal ablation that varies them independently would settle this (see Future experiments → Causal ablation in `content_masterarbeit.md`).
- **baseline vs sparse** differs in *exactly four* keys, all on the architecture axis (`sparse_attention=True` plus the three neighbor-count keys). The training recipe is byte-identical to the baseline. Therefore, when the sparse designability eval is run, the result is unambiguously attributable to architecture — there is no v2-style recipe confound. (Earlier session confusion suggested the sparse run might have inherited the v2 recipe because `configs/training_ca_only.yaml` still had v2 leftover values at the time of sparse submission. Verified on 2026-04-26 from the saved `exp_config_ca_only_sparse_K40.json`: it did not. Hydra picks one root config per `--config-name`, and `training_ca_only_sparse.yaml` was always at the canonical recipe.)

**The K=40 misnomer (sparse run):**

The sparse run is named `ca_only_sparse_K40` and earlier writeups described the architecture as "K=40 = 16 sequential + 8 spatial + 16 random". The saved `exp_config_ca_only_sparse_K40.json` and runtime `cfg_exp.nn` log both show `n_seq_neighbors=8` (not 16), `n_spatial_neighbors=8`, `n_random_neighbors=16` ⇒ **K=32 (8 seq / 8 spatial / 16 random)**. Half the sequential count claimed in the docs. The model sees ±4 residues sequentially per layer, not ±8. Long-range information transport relies even more heavily on multi-layer composition than the K=40 framing suggested. The throughput observation is unaffected (gathered tensor `[B*H,N,K,D]` is 32/40 = 0.8× the K=40 size, still firmly memory-bound). Run name kept for store-dir / wandb continuity.

**Possible narrative:** **Yes — this is the "Run comparison — baseline / v2 / sparse" entry in `content_masterarbeit.md`** (`## Run comparison — baseline / v2 / sparse (clean config, side-by-side, 2026-04-26)`). Treat that section as the citation anchor for any thesis claim about these three runs.

**Methodological caveats:**
- Sparse arm is mid-training; its row in the designability table is empty until the post-training eval runs. Comparison is therefore 2-of-3 complete.
- Diff isolation argument for baseline vs sparse holds *only if* the eval is run on the locked recipe — re-tuning anything during the sparse run would re-introduce confounds.
